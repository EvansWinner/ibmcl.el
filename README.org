* ctrl-lang.el

This is an Emacs Lisp library I wrote to do syntax highlighting for
IBM’s AS/400 Control Language (CL).  It doesn’t do much besides that,
though it does have a nice function to get IBM’s documentation about
CL commands.

It was my first attempt to write a mode, and it uses
`define-generic-mode’ to do the work.  It does what it does.  Anyway,
at some point I may re-write it and update the list of commands and
built-in functions to be in line with modern (ca. IBM i 7.1) CL.
